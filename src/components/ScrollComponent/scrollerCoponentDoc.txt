## ScrollComponent

### Overview
The `ScrollComponent` is a React component that utilizes the Swiper library to create a vertical scrolling carousel. It renders a Swiper component and multiple SwiperSlide components, each containing a CardScroller component.

### Dependencies
The component imports the following modules:
- `Swiper` and `SwiperSlide` from "swiper/react": These components are used to create the Swiper carousel and its individual slides.
- `Autoplay`, `Pagination`, and `Navigation` from "swiper": These modules are required for configuring autoplay, pagination, and navigation functionalities in the Swiper component.
- "swiper/css" for importing Swiper styles.
- "swiper/css/navigation" and "swiper/css/pagination" for importing specific styles related to navigation and pagination.

### Rendering
The `ScrollComponent` component renders the following JSX code:
- An empty fragment element (`<>...</>`) is used as a wrapper to group the Swiper component and its slides.
- A `<br />` element is added for spacing purposes.
- The `Swiper` component is rendered with the following props:
  - `direction` set to "vertical" to enable vertical scrolling.
  - `modules` array containing `Autoplay`, `Pagination`, and `Navigation` for enabling autoplay, pagination, and navigation functionalities.
  - `mousewheel` set to `true` to enable scrolling with the mouse wheel.
  - `autoplay` object with a `delay` of 1000ms (1 second) between slide transitions.
  - `spaceBetween` set to 10 to add spacing between slides.
  - `loop` set to `true` to enable looping through slides.
  - `className` with CSS classes for styling and layout.
  - `slidesPerView` set to 4 to determine the number of slides visible at once.
  - `speed` set to 5000ms (5 seconds) for the transition speed between slides.
- Multiple `SwiperSlide` components are rendered, each containing a `CardScroller` component.
- The `CardScroller` component represents the content of each slide within the Swiper carousel.

### Export
The `ScrollComponent` component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.
