## CurrencyConverter Component

The `CurrencyConverter` component is a React component that represents a currency converter form. It allows users to convert currencies based on an input amount and selected currencies. The component utilizes various dependencies and APIs to handle form validation, currency conversion, and data retrieval.

### Usage
To use the `CurrencyConverter` component, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary dependencies:
   - `useState` from the 'react' library.
   - `Dropdowns` from the './CurrencyComponents/Dropdowns' file.
   - `ConvertResult` from the './CurrencyComponents/ConvertResult' file.
   - `useForm` from the 'react-hook-form' library.
   - `yupResolver` from the '@hookform/resolvers/yup' library.
   - `yup` for defining form validation schema.
   - `getConverterCurService` from the '../../../api/services/getConverterCur' file.
   - `convertCurrency` from the '../../../api/services/convertCurrency' file.

2. Add the `CurrencyConverter` component to your JSX markup:
   ```javascript
   function App() {
     return (
       <div>
         {/* Other components */}
         <CurrencyConverter />
         {/* Other components */}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Customize the appearance and behavior of the component by modifying the associated CSS file 'cureency.css'.

### Component Structure
The `CurrencyConverter` component is structured as follows:

- The component is wrapped in a `div` element with the CSS classes 'w-full', 'hover:mr-2', 'flex', 'flex-col', 'container', 'justify-center', 'items-start', and 'rounded-2xl'. This provides a responsive and centered layout for the currency converter form.

- The component consists of a `form` element that handles form submission and validation.

- The form includes two sections:
  1. **From Section:**
     - This section allows users to select the source currency and enter the amount to be converted.
     - It includes a `Dropdowns` component for selecting the currency and an `input` element for entering the amount.

  2. **To Section:**
     - This section displays the converted amount in the target currency.
     - It includes a label and a `div` element to display the converted amount.

- The form also includes error messages for form validation and a submit button for initiating the currency conversion.

### Customization
You can customize the component by modifying the following:

- The appearance and behavior of the form inputs can be customized by modifying the associated CSS classes.

- The form validation schema can be adjusted using the `yup` library. Update the `schema` object according to your validation requirements.

- The API services for retrieving currency data and performing currency conversion can be customized by modifying the `getConverterCurService` and `convertCurrency` functions, respectively.

Note: This documentation assumes that the `Dropdowns` and `ConvertResult` components are implemented correctly and handle the functionality related to dropdown menus and displaying conversion results, respectively.
